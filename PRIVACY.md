# Privacy Policy for TODO++

**Last Updated: February 15, 2026**

## Overview

TODO++ ("the Plugin") is developed and maintained by Vennam Prasad ("we", "us", or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## Data Collection

**TODO++ does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

The plugin operates entirely locally within your IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio environment and:

- ✅ **Does NOT collect** any personal information
- ✅ **Does NOT track** your usage or behavior
- ✅ **Does NOT transmit** any data to external servers
- ✅ **Does NOT use** analytics or tracking tools
- ✅ **Does NOT store** data outside your local machine

## What the Plugin Does

TODO++ scans your project files locally to find and display TODO comments. All processing happens on your computer. The plugin:

- Reads TODO comments from your source code files
- Displays them in a tool window
- Stores preferences locally in your IDE settings
- All data remains on your machine

## Local Data Storage

The only data stored by TODO++ is:

- **User Preferences**: Filter settings, window positions (stored in your IDE's local configuration)
- **Scan Results**: Cached TODO items (stored temporarily in memory during your IDE session)

All data is stored locally in your IDE's configuration directory and is never transmitted anywhere.

## Third-Party Services

TODO++ does not integrate with or communicate with any third-party services or APIs.

## Children's Privacy

TODO++ does not knowingly collect information from anyone under the age of 13. The plugin is designed for professional developers.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the plugin's documentation and GitHub repository.

## Your Rights
